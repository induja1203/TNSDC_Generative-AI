Introduction:

This repository contains code for predicting cancer using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Cancer prediction is a critical task in the medical field, and machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning methods like RNNs, have shown promising results in this domain. This README file serves as a guide to understand the contents of this repository and how to utilize the provided code.

Contents:

Dataset:

The dataset used for training and testing the RNN model should be provided. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and formatted appropriately for input to the RNN.


/content/cancer.csv


Code Files:

data_preprocessing.py: Contains code for preprocessing the dataset, such as data cleaning, normalization, and splitting into training and testing sets.
rnn_model.py: Implements the Recurrent Neural Network architecture for cancer prediction.
train_rnn.py: Script for training the RNN model on the preprocessed dataset.
test_rnn.py: Script for evaluating the trained RNN model on a separate test dataset.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (based on the implementation choice)
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualization, if needed)
Usage:

Data Preprocessing:

Run data_preprocessing.py to preprocess the dataset. Ensure the dataset file path is correctly specified within the script.
Training the Model:

Execute train_rnn.py to train the RNN model using the preprocessed dataset. You may need to adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs based on your dataset and computational resources.
Testing the Model:

After training, run test_rnn.py to evaluate the trained model on a separate test dataset. Make sure to provide the path to the test dataset within the script.
Fine-tuning:

Depending on the performance of the model, you can fine-tune hyperparameters or even the architecture of the RNN model to achieve better results.
Deployment:

Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in your desired environment for cancer prediction tasks.
